             At runtime, each component receives exactly the properties it needs based on its blockType
             The alternative would be to implement a complex structure of discriminated types that could be excessive
             If we prefer a solution without @ts-ignore, we could:
             Create a specific discriminated union type for each component
             Extract only the properties that each component needs
             Implement a custom renderer for each block type
             But for most cases, @ts-ignore is sufficient and keeps the code simpler */}
